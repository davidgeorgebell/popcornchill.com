## Built using

- React with Hooks
- React Context for state management
- TMDB API (The movie database)
- CSS

This website is built using React Hooks and with re usability in mind, so I created my own reusable `useFetch` hook for fetching data from the individual end points. The website includes a dark and light theme for user preference stored in local storage so theme is set for repeat visits. The theme state is managed using React Context for maintainable management. I also used Context for managing the state of the Genre list being viewed. As the genre title was not provided by the data source so, using context to create a solution.

### Things I enjoyed whilst building this

- Using a re usable hook to easily manage data fetching
- Using Reacts Context for state management
- Being creative with layouts and styling design inspired by art I enjoy

## Description

I built this app with React and the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/) for getting data. I wanted to create a clutter free, clean movie website. A way to find a movie to watch quick and easy with good UI but without the clutter of other movie review sites. The website is responsive with a dark and light theme for users choice.
